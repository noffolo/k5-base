# Walkthrough: Fix Panel Logs Shell (Explicit Layout)

I have applied the fix for the missing Panel shell by explicitly setting the layout to "inside". 

## Changes Made

### Panel Logs Plugin

#### [index.php](file:///Users/ff3300/Desktop/SITI/k5-base/site/plugins/panel-logs/index.php)
- Added `'layout' => 'inside'` to the `panel-logs` area definition.
- Added `'layout' => 'inside'` to the view action response.
- These explicit properties force Kirby's Fiber system to render the view within the main Panel shell (sidebar and header).

#### [index.js](file:///Users/ff3300/Desktop/SITI/k5-base/site/plugins/panel-logs/index.js)
- Confirmed that the Vue component uses `<k-view layout="inside">`.
- The component is registered as `panel-logs-view`.

## Verification

### Manual Verification Required
- Please reload the Panel and navigate to "Logs attività".
- Verify that the sidebar and header are now visible as expected.
