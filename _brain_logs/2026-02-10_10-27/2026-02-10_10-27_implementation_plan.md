# Project File Relationship Graph Plan

The goal is to generate a comprehensive Mermaid diagram showing the relationships between Blueprints, Templates, Controllers, Models, Snippets, and Assets in the Kirby CMS project.

## Proposed Changes

### [NEW] [project_graph.md](file:///Users/ff3300/.gemini/antigravity/brain/70b1513e-acfa-42b7-8f01-51e4a3232cf0/project_graph.md)
Creation of a dedicated artifact containing the Mermaid relationship graph.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- Review the generated Mermaid diagram to ensure all key relationships (Templates -> Snippets, Templates -> Controllers, etc.) are accurately represented.
- Verify that file paths in the graph are correct.
