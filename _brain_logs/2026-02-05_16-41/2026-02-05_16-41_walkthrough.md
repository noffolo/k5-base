# Walkthrough - Swiper Loop Fix

I have implemented a fix for the "Swiper Loop Warning" and added protections for empty sliders.

## Changes Made

### Frontend Assets
- **[scripts.js](file:///Users/ff3300/Desktop/SITI/k5-base/assets/src/js/scripts.js)**:
    - Added logic to count slides before initialization.
    - Dynamically set `loop: true` only if there is more than 1 slide.
    - For `.block-cards-list`, disabled loop if there are 4 or fewer slides (matching the max `slidesPerView`).
    - Hidden empty sliders automatically (`display: none`).
    - Hid navigation arrows and pagination if they are not needed (1 or 0 slides).

### Slider Block
- **[slider.php](file:///Users/ff3300/Desktop/SITI/k5-base/site/plugins/block-factory/snippets/blocks/slider.php)**:
    - Added a PHP check to avoid rendering the Swiper HTML structure entirely if the slider is empty.
    - Fixed a syntax error (missing `endif`).

## Verification Results

### Console Warnings
- Verified that the "Swiper Loop Warning" no longer appears when a slider has few or no slides.

### UI behavior
- Sliders with 1 slide now display correctly without attempting to loop.
- Empty sliders are cleanly removed from the DOM/hidden, preventing layout issues.
- Sliders with multiple slides continue to loop and autoplay as expected.
