# Renamed Project to k5-base

The project has been successfully decoupled from Spazio13 and generalized to "k5-base". A full backup was created before any changes were made.

## Changes Made

### Backup
- Created a full copy of the project at `/Users/ff3300/Desktop/SITI/k5-spazio13-backup`.

### Metadata and Configuration
- Updated [composer.json](file:///Users/ff3300/Desktop/SITI/k5-spazio13/composer.json) name to `ff3300/k5-base`.
- Updated [package.json](file:///Users/ff3300/Desktop/SITI/k5-spazio13/package.json) name to `k5_base`.

### Git
- Removed the `origin` remote pointing to the Spazio13 GitHub repository.

### Generalization
- Updated project title in [components.md](file:///Users/ff3300/Desktop/SITI/k5-spazio13/docs/components.md).
- Updated project references in [.agent/rules/general-principles.md](file:///Users/ff3300/Desktop/SITI/k5-spazio13/.agent/rules/general-principles.md).
- Cleared logs and cache to remove specific references.

## Verification Results

### No "spazio13" references (excluding content/logs)
Checked with:
```bash
grep -ri "spazio13" . --exclude-dir=vendor --exclude-dir=content --exclude-dir=_brain_logs --exclude-dir=.git --exclude-dir=node_modules
```

### Git Remote Removed
Verified with:
```bash
git remote -v
```
(No output, as expected)
